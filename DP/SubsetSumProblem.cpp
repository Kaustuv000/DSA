// if a subset is present in the given array whose sum is given as the target sum
// result in true or false, we dont need to return the sum

// if only one array is given, then take it as a weight array


// if two arrays are given, then take the first array as the weight array and the second array as the value array  

// the sum of all the elements in the array should be even, so we can divide it into two subsets with equal sum
// else we cannot divide it into two subsets with equal sum and return false
